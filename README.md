Basics of ArUco -
ArUco markers are binary square fiducial markers that can be used for camera pose estimation. Their main benefit is that their detection is robust, fast and simple.
The aruco module includes the detection of these types of markers and the tools to employ them for pose estimation and camera calibration.
